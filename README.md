# Matrix-Multiplication.
This C++ code is a program that performs matrix multiplication of two 3x3 matrices and displays the result if multiplication is possible cheking the condition.
The condition is to compare the number of columns in the second matrix (r2) to the number of rows in the first matrix (c1).
If these values are not equal, it prints "Can't multiply!" to indicate that matrix multiplication is not possible.
If the condition is met, the program proceeds to perform the matrix multiplication and display the result.
